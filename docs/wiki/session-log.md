## 2026-04-12 — relief-lab live state sync

**Branch:** main

### Spec

Make the `relief-lab` control panel read and follow live map state
instead of initializing itself from the input style JSON.

### Design decisions

- Added public renderer readback methods for illumination, rendering
  options, and vertical exaggeration, proxied on all public interface
  layers.
- `setIllumination()`, `setRenderingOptions()`, and
  `setVerticalExaggeration()` now mark the map dirty so runtime changes
  redraw immediately.
- The demo now polls public getters on each `tick` and reconciles the
  panel from that live state instead of inspecting style contents.
- Rendering-option overrides continue to live on `renderer.debug`; this
  work intentionally does not introduce a second storage layer.

### Non-obvious finding

The relief-lab shading checkboxes do not map to independent renderer
flags in normal operation. Their effective state is derived from the
stored illumination weights, so polling reconstructs checkbox state from
the current weights rather than from diagnostic render-flag overrides.

## 2026-04-12 — relief-lab demo and diffuse color API

**Branch:** main

### Spec

Add the `relief-lab` demo application at `demos/relief-lab/index.html`. The demo exposes
illumination, shading, and vertical-exaggeration parameters through a collapsible side panel
with three tabs. Full specification: [docs/wiki/relief-lab-spec.md](relief-lab-spec.md).

Two API additions were required:

1. **`diffuseColor`** — previously the diffuse light color was hardcoded as
   `[1−ambcf, 1−ambcf, 1−ambcf]` in `updateBuffers()`. A `diffuseColor` field is added to
   `Renderer.IlluminationDef`, the internal `Illumination` type, and
   `MapStyle.IlluminationSpecification` (for style-file authoring). `updateBuffers()` now
   scales the authored color so its maximum RGB component equals `1 − ambientCoef`.
2. **`setRenderingOptions()`** — new public method on `Renderer` (and proxied on all three
   interface layers) accepting `Renderer.RenderingOptions`. Allows callers to toggle rendering
   flags (`useNormalMaps`, `useDiffuseMaps`, etc.) without accessing internal debug fields.

### Design decisions

- `useLighting` is **not** part of `RenderingOptions`; it remains in `IlluminationDef`.
  The `FlagLighting` UBO bit is conditional on `getIlluminationState()` (which checks
  `illumination.useLighting`). Keeping the two concerns separate avoids an ambiguous double
  switch.
- Diffuse color default is `[1, 1, 1]` (white), giving the same behaviour as before when
  no explicit color is provided.
- The style schema addition (`diffuseColor` in `IlluminationSpecification`) piggybacks on the
  existing style → `setIllumination()` pipeline without any additional plumbing.

## 2026-04-11 — Geographic illumination mode

**Branch:** main

### Spec

Add a second illumination light type, `geographic`, alongside the
existing observer-relative `tracking` light.

### Design decisions

- The public light shape stays shared across modes:
  `{ type, azimuth, elevation, specular? }`, with legacy tuple syntax
  kept for `tracking` only.
- Runtime illumination state stores one authored vector plus the two
  renderer-facing derived vectors, `vectorNED` and `vectorVC`.
- `tracking` keeps the existing lNED-authored behavior: `vectorVC` is
  initialized once in `setIllumination()`, while `updateIllumination()`
  recomputes only `vectorNED`.
- `geographic` authors the vector in scene-center NED: `vectorNED` is
  initialized once in `setIllumination()`, while
  `updateIllumination()` derives only `vectorVC` through the existing
  `ned2lned`/`ned2vc` path.
- `setIllumination()` is now proxied on renderer, core, and browser
  interfaces just like `setVerticalExaggeration()`.

### Non-obvious finding

Style loading can call `setIllumination()` before `map.position` is
initialized. The geographic runtime recompute therefore needs a guarded
initialization path and must defer the full position-dependent update to
the first render-frame refresh.

## 2026-04-11 — Fully functional aspect-based shading

**Branch:** main

### Spec

Finish the previously plumbed aspect shading mode so it affects diffuse
terrain shading together with Lambertian and slope shading.

### Design decisions

- `diffuseCoef()` now centralizes the shading combination logic instead
  of duplicating the per-term calculations inline in `main()`.
- The combined shading formula is treated as a weighted geometric mean
  of the three shading coefficients' complements, then remapped back to
  the final shading coefficient.
- The accumulator was named `diffuseComplement` to reflect the math more
  accurately than the earlier `invDiffuseCoef`.

### Non-obvious finding

Aspect shading produced black speckles on nearly flat terrain. The
underlying issue was not the weighted-product formula itself but numeric
instability in the projected-direction cosine used by the aspect term:
on flat areas the tangent-plane projection of the normal approaches
zero, so aspect needs a neutral fallback in those degenerate cases to
avoid visible artifacts.

## 2026-04-11 — Aspect shading flag/weight plumbing

**Branch:** main

### Spec

Add a third diagnostic/configurable shading mode, `aspect`, following
the existing Lambertian and slope plumbing. The new mode must expose:

- `mapShadingAspect` config flag, default `false`
- `shadingAspectWeight` illumination/style option, default `0.25`
- renderer debug override and frame-UBO propagation
- diagnostic render-flags toggle on plain `x` inside `Shift+F`

The fragment shader must receive the new flag and weight but must not
change rendered output yet.

### Design decisions

- Aspect shading uses the next render-flag bit after slope
  (`FlagShadingAspect = 1 << 9`).
- `shadingParams.z` carries the aspect weight; `w` stays reserved.
- The diagnostic shortcut remains `a` for atmosphere; aspect uses `x`
  to avoid conflicting with the existing render-flags key map.

### Non-obvious finding

The tile fragment shader already computes an `aspectCoef`, so the
plumbing work only needed a no-op reference to the new flag/weight to
keep them live without changing shading behavior.

## 2026-04-10 — Scale-denominator vertical exaggeration

**Branch:** main
**HEAD:** 4c2239734393de3a99c334699243ffc10931143e

### Spec

> *Reconstructed from session context — review for accuracy.*

Introduce a new `vertical-exaggeration` style interface with two
independent components:

**1. Elevation ramp** — piecewise linear by terrain height, same
semantics as the existing `heightRamp`. Specified as two pivot pairs:

```yaml
vertical-exaggeration:
  elevationRamp:
    min: [height_min, factor_min]
    max: [height_max, factor_max]
```

**2. Scale-denominator ramp** — power-law function of the CSS scale
denominator. Specified as two pivot pairs:

```yaml
vertical-exaggeration:
  scaleRamp:
    min: [sd_min, va_min]
    max: [sd_max, va_max]
```

The scale denominator is a cartographic quantity independent of canvas
size and DPI:

```
sd = extent / (cssH_px / cssDpi * 0.0254)
```

where `cssH_px` is the apparent canvas height in CSS pixels and
`cssDpi` defaults to 96.

The ramp is log-log linear (power law) between the two pivots:

```
va(sd) = va_min * (sd / sd_min) ^ (log(va_max / va_min) / log(sd_max / sd_min))
```

At `sd = sd_min` this returns `va_min`; at `sd = sd_max` it returns
`va_max`. Outside the range, `sd` is clamped.

**Compatibility:** The legacy `heightRamp` / `viewExtentProgression`
style syntax must continue to work. It is converted internally to the
new `veScaleRamp` representation using a canonical canvas height of
1113 CSS px (the historical tuning baseline), giving 1:1 behavioural
equivalence at that height.

**New public method** `setVerticalExaggeration(spec)` on `Renderer`,
proxied on `RendererInterface`, `CoreInterface`, and `BrowserInterface`.

**New config param** `rendererCssDpi` (default 96) for deployments
where CSS DPI differs from the standard.

### Design decisions

- The internal type `VeScaleRamp { sd0, va0, sd1, va1, exponent }`
  replaces `SeProgression`. The exponent is precomputed as
  `log(va1/va0) / log(sd1/sd0)`.

- Legacy `viewExtentProgression` input is converted to `veScaleRamp` at
  load time using a canonical 1113 CSS px height. This value matches the
  historical tuning baseline (maximized browser window on the development
  machine), giving a 1:1 behavioural match for existing styles.

- `VerticalExaggerationSpecification` in `style.ts` is a strict
  discriminated union: new format (`elevationRamp`/`scaleRamp`) or legacy
  format (`heightRamp`/`viewExtentProgression`), never mixed.

- `rendererCssDpi` (default 96) is a new renderer config param for
  deployments where CSS DPI differs from the standard 96.

### Non-obvious finding: hitmap framebuffer and `curSize`

During label hierarchy computation, the engine periodically switches to
a fixed-size offscreen framebuffer (hitmap). This temporarily sets
`curSize = [hitmapSize, hitmapSize]`. Any code reading `this.css()[1]`
during this window gets the framebuffer height instead of the viewport
height.

**Fix:** `mainViewportCssH` — a dedicated field updated only in
`applySizes` (called on real viewport resize). `currentScaleDenominator`
uses this field instead of `this.css()[1] * this.visibleScale_[1]`.

### Renames

| Old name | New name |
|---|---|
| `getSeProgressionFactor` | `getVeScaleFactor` |
| `setSuperElevationProgression` | `setVeScaleRampFromProgression` (deprecated) |
| `seProgression` / `SeProgression` | `veScaleRamp` / `VeScaleRamp` |
