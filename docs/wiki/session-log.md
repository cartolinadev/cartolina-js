## 2026-04-13 — Strict TypeScript (in progress)

**Branch:** feature/relief-lab

### Spec

Enable `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json` and fix all resulting
errors so the codebase compiles cleanly under strict mode.

### Work done

**`AGENTS.md`** — added `npx tsc (any flags)` to the list of commands
that may be run without permission.

**`CLAUDE.md`** — rewrote the Shell commands section to enumerate
the categories of auto-approved commands (POSIX analysis tools,
`npx tsc`, screenshots, curl).

**`.claude/settings.local.json`** — added
`"Bash(source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh:*)"` to auto-approve all nvm-prefixed
commands so future sessions do not require manual approval.

**`/home/prochazka/.claude/settings.json`** — added broad allow
entries for `awk`, `grep`, `sed`, `wc`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, and
`source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh:*`.

### Current state — 199 strict errors across these files

| File | Approx errors |
|---|---|
| `src/core/utils/utils.ts` | ~82 |
| `src/core/utils/math.ts` | ~36 |
| `src/core/renderer/renderer.ts` | ~39 |
| `src/core/renderer/gpu/texture.ts` | ~21 |
| `src/core/map/style.ts` | ~8 |
| `src/core/map/surface-sequence.ts` | ~7 |
| `src/core/map/body.ts` | ~2 |
| `src/core/renderer/gpu/program.ts` | ~1 |
| `src/core/renderer/gpu/device.ts` | ~1 |
| `src/core/map/tile-render-rig.ts` | ~1 |
| typia / earcut (external) | ~2 |

Error classes: almost entirely **TS7006** (implicit `any` parameter)
and a handful of **TS7005** (implicit `any` variable). The work is
mechanical annotation — no architectural changes required.

### Next steps

1. Enable `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json` (remove the two
   `strict: false` / `strictNullChecks: false` lines or set to `true`).
2. Fix errors file by file in this order:
   - `math.ts` (pure math utilities, simplest to annotate)
   - `utils.ts` (largest file; mostly implicit `any` params)
   - `renderer.ts`
   - `texture.ts`
   - `surface-sequence.ts`, `style.ts`, `body.ts` (small)
   - `program.ts`, `device.ts`, `tile-render-rig.ts` (single errors)
3. The earcut external module error is resolved by either providing
   a `@types/earcut` package or adding a local `.d.ts` shim — check
   first whether `@types/earcut` exists on npm.
4. Run `node test/screenshot.js` on the three canonical test URLs to
   confirm no regressions.

### Pre-existing issues also pending

- **`src/core/map/interface.d.ts` line 20** — `InstanceType<typeof
  MapInterface>` fails because `MapInterface` is an ES5 constructor
  function `(map: any) => void`, not a class. Fix: create
  `src/core/map/interface.d.ts` with a proper `class MapInterface`
  declaration (same pattern as `surface-tile.d.ts`), then change
  `interface.d.ts` (core) to use `MapInterface` directly.
- **`src/browser/viewer.ts` line 59** — `MapInterface` used as a
  type annotation; will be fixed automatically once
  `map/interface.d.ts` exists.

## 2026-04-13 — dist build regression after BrowserInterface removal

**Branch:** feature/relief-lab

### Spec

Restore the production dist bundle after the `Viewer` migration:
`cartolina.min.css` had disappeared from output and the legacy browser
API shape had regressed.

### Work done

**`src/browser/index.ts`** — moved browser CSS imports to the browser
entry module so webpack still emits `cartolina.min.css` and
`cartolina.min.css.map` after wrapper refactors.

### Non-obvious findings

- Removing `BrowserInterface` also removed the only browser-CSS side
  effect imports, so webpack silently stopped emitting the stylesheet.

- The missing browser CSS was enough to mimic a major runtime failure:
  the browser/map wrapper lost its full-size layout and the generic
  fallback "needs WebGL capable browser" overlay became visible because
  CSS, not code, hides it by default.

## 2026-04-13 — Viewer TS API and JS→TS migration groundwork

**Branch:** feature/relief-lab

### Spec

Establish `Viewer` as the typed TypeScript public API surface, put
migration rules in place, and apply them to a first concrete case.

### Work done

**`src/browser/viewer.ts`** — new `Viewer` class wrapping `Browser` /
`CoreInterface`. Flat, typed method surface covering lifecycle, events,
camera, render control, coordinate conversion, and hit-testing.
Exported as the type alias `Map` from the package index.

**`src/core/types.ts`** — shared primitive types for the core layer:
`HeightMode`, `Lod`, `CoreEventMap`. `CoreEventMap` types the event
name parameter on `on()` / `once()` so unknown event names are a
compile error.

**`src/core/interface.d.ts`** — declaration file alongside
`interface.js`, replacing the earlier `ICoreInterface` boundary
interface in `types.ts`. Shape declaration co-located with
implementation.

**`src/core/map/surface-tile.d.ts`** — declaration file alongside
`surface-tile.js`, covering the properties accessed by
`tile-render-rig.ts`. Replaced the local `SurfaceTile` adapter type
that was defined at the bottom of that file.

**`AGENTS.md`** — JS→TS migration rules section added (when to use
direct JS references, `.d.ts`, or `types.ts`).

**`docs/wiki/architecture.md`** — event bus, kill pattern, and
Browser→Viewer dissolution goal documented.

### Design decisions

- No parallel boundary interfaces (`IFoo` in a separate file). Use
  `.d.ts` next to the `.js` for complex shapes; use `types.ts` for
  simple reusable primitives. Both patterns validated this session.

- `Viewer` is the only place for new public functionality. `Browser`
  is legacy infrastructure on the path to dissolution — nothing new
  goes there.

- `CoreEventMap` payloads typed as `unknown` for now; the value is
  in the typed event names, not the payloads.

### Non-obvious findings

- `@ts-ignore` is not needed on JS module imports under `allowJs`.
  TypeScript resolves them cleanly without it.

- A single `as T` cast is sufficient when the source is `any`.
  The `as unknown as T` double cast is only needed when both the
  source and target are concrete, non-overlapping types.

- `.d.ts` alongside `.js` works correctly under `allowJs: true` —
  TypeScript prefers the `.d.ts` over inferred JS types even when the
  JS file is part of the compilation. The pattern is valid for
  incremental migration.


## 2026-04-12 — labels render flag

**Branch:** main

### Spec

Add a `labels` render flag (`useLabels`, `FlagUseLabels`) that
suppresses style-defined labels from the user’s perspective and expose
it through map options, diagnostics render-flags mode, and
`demos/relief-lab`.

### Design decisions

- The public-facing `labels` flag is implemented by suppressing the
  geodata/free-layer render paths in the draw loop, because authored
  label layers are compiled into synthetic geodata free layers.
- The effective value follows the same precedence as the other render
  flags: `renderer.debug.flagLabels ?? map.config.mapFlagLabels`.
- The flag is propagated through the frame render-flags UBO even though
  no current shader consumes it directly.
- Geodata hit-testing is gated by the same effective flag so hidden
  labels do not remain hoverable or clickable.
- Diagnostics render-flags mode uses plain `k` for labels, leaving the
  existing `Shift+K` “all labels” debug shortcut intact.

## 2026-04-12 — relief-lab atmosphere controls

**Branch:** main

### Spec

Add live atmosphere controls to the `Light & Shading` tab in
`demos/relief-lab`, with public core/browser API readback and update
support.

### Design decisions

- The public atmosphere API exposes only the three runtime-tunable
  fields: `maxVisibility`, `visibilityToEyeDistance`, and
  `edgeDistanceToEyeDistance`. These are defined on
  `Atmosphere.RuntimeParameters`; `Atmosphere.Specification` is derived
  as `MapBody.Atmosphere & RuntimeParameters` (not the reverse) to avoid
  duplicating the field definitions.
- `setAtmosphere()` / `getAtmosphere()` are on `CoreInterface` and
  `BrowserInterface` only. They reach `map.atmosphere` directly — the
  renderer interface is not in the chain.
- `markDirty()` is called inside `Atmosphere.setRuntimeParameters()`
  via `this.renderer.core.map.markDirty()`, so the interface layer does
  not need to handle it.
- The `useAtmosphere` render flag remains the master on/off switch and
  is replicated at the top of the new panel section; disabling it does
  not discard the authored atmosphere parameter state.
- The two ratio parameters remain presence-based optionals, so the UI
  uses checkboxes to control whether each field is authored at all.

## 2026-04-12 — relief-lab demo and runtime-state sync

**Branch:** main

### Spec

Implement `demos/relief-lab/index.html` from
[docs/wiki/relief-lab-spec.md](relief-lab-spec.md), then make the demo
follow live map state rather than initializing itself from style JSON.

### Design decisions

- Added public renderer readback for illumination, rendering options,
  and vertical exaggeration, proxied through renderer/core/browser
  interfaces, so the demo can treat the map as the source of truth.
- `setIllumination()`, `setRenderingOptions()`, and
  `setVerticalExaggeration()` now mark the map dirty so runtime changes
  redraw immediately.
- The demo polls those public getters on each `tick` and reconciles its
  controls from live renderer state instead of reading style internals.
- Rendering-option overrides remain on `renderer.debug`; the public API
  intentionally reuses that existing storage rather than introducing a
  second override layer.
- `useLighting` remains part of illumination rather than
  `RenderingOptions`; the frame render flag follows
  `illumination.useLighting` through the existing illumination-state
  path.
- `diffuseColor` was added to the authored illumination spec and
  renderer runtime, replacing the previous hardcoded white diffuse term.

## 2026-04-11 — Geographic illumination mode

**Branch:** main

### Spec

Add a second illumination light type, `geographic`, alongside the
existing observer-relative `tracking` light.

### Design decisions

- The public light shape stays shared across modes:
  `{ type, azimuth, elevation, specular? }`, with legacy tuple syntax
  kept for `tracking` only.
- Runtime illumination state stores one authored vector plus the two
  renderer-facing derived vectors, `vectorNED` and `vectorVC`.
- `tracking` keeps the existing lNED-authored behavior: `vectorVC` is
  initialized once in `setIllumination()`, while `updateIllumination()`
  recomputes only `vectorNED`.
- `geographic` authors the vector in scene-center NED: `vectorNED` is
  initialized once in `setIllumination()`, while
  `updateIllumination()` derives only `vectorVC` through the existing
  `ned2lned`/`ned2vc` path.
- `setIllumination()` is now proxied on renderer, core, and browser
  interfaces just like `setVerticalExaggeration()`.

### Non-obvious finding

Style loading can call `setIllumination()` before `map.position` is
initialized. The geographic runtime recompute therefore needs a guarded
initialization path and must defer the full position-dependent update to
the first render-frame refresh.

## 2026-04-11 — Fully functional aspect-based shading

**Branch:** main

### Spec

Finish the previously plumbed aspect shading mode so it affects diffuse
terrain shading together with Lambertian and slope shading.

### Design decisions

- `diffuseCoef()` now centralizes the shading combination logic instead
  of duplicating the per-term calculations inline in `main()`.
- The combined shading formula is treated as a weighted geometric mean
  of the three shading coefficients' complements, then remapped back to
  the final shading coefficient.
- The accumulator was named `diffuseComplement` to reflect the math more
  accurately than the earlier `invDiffuseCoef`.

### Non-obvious finding

Aspect shading produced black speckles on nearly flat terrain. The
underlying issue was not the weighted-product formula itself but numeric
instability in the projected-direction cosine used by the aspect term:
on flat areas the tangent-plane projection of the normal approaches
zero, so aspect needs a neutral fallback in those degenerate cases to
avoid visible artifacts.

## 2026-04-11 — Aspect shading flag/weight plumbing

**Branch:** main

### Spec

Add a third diagnostic/configurable shading mode, `aspect`, following
the existing Lambertian and slope plumbing. The new mode must expose:

- `mapShadingAspect` config flag, default `false`
- `shadingAspectWeight` illumination/style option, default `0.25`
- renderer debug override and frame-UBO propagation
- diagnostic render-flags toggle on plain `x` inside `Shift+F`

The fragment shader must receive the new flag and weight but must not
change rendered output yet.

### Design decisions

- Aspect shading uses the next render-flag bit after slope
  (`FlagShadingAspect = 1 << 9`).
- `shadingParams.z` carries the aspect weight; `w` stays reserved.
- The diagnostic shortcut remains `a` for atmosphere; aspect uses `x`
  to avoid conflicting with the existing render-flags key map.

### Non-obvious finding

The tile fragment shader already computes an `aspectCoef`, so the
plumbing work only needed a no-op reference to the new flag/weight to
keep them live without changing shading behavior.

## 2026-04-10 — Scale-denominator vertical exaggeration

**Branch:** main
**HEAD:** 4c2239734393de3a99c334699243ffc10931143e

### Spec

> *Reconstructed from session context — review for accuracy.*

Introduce a new `vertical-exaggeration` style interface with two
independent components:

**1. Elevation ramp** — piecewise linear by terrain height, same
semantics as the existing `heightRamp`. Specified as two pivot pairs:

```yaml
vertical-exaggeration:
  elevationRamp:
    min: [height_min, factor_min]
    max: [height_max, factor_max]
```

**2. Scale-denominator ramp** — power-law function of the CSS scale
denominator. Specified as two pivot pairs:

```yaml
vertical-exaggeration:
  scaleRamp:
    min: [sd_min, va_min]
    max: [sd_max, va_max]
```

The scale denominator is a cartographic quantity independent of canvas
size and DPI:

```
sd = extent / (cssH_px / cssDpi * 0.0254)
```

where `cssH_px` is the apparent canvas height in CSS pixels and
`cssDpi` defaults to 96.

The ramp is log-log linear (power law) between the two pivots:

```
va(sd) = va_min * (sd / sd_min) ^ (log(va_max / va_min) / log(sd_max / sd_min))
```

At `sd = sd_min` this returns `va_min`; at `sd = sd_max` it returns
`va_max`. Outside the range, `sd` is clamped.

**Compatibility:** The legacy `heightRamp` / `viewExtentProgression`
style syntax must continue to work. It is converted internally to the
new `veScaleRamp` representation using a canonical canvas height of
1113 CSS px (the historical tuning baseline), giving 1:1 behavioural
equivalence at that height.

**New public method** `setVerticalExaggeration(spec)` on `Renderer`,
proxied on `RendererInterface`, `CoreInterface`, and `BrowserInterface`.

**New config param** `rendererCssDpi` (default 96) for deployments
where CSS DPI differs from the standard.

### Design decisions

- The internal type `VeScaleRamp { sd0, va0, sd1, va1, exponent }`
  replaces `SeProgression`. The exponent is precomputed as
  `log(va1/va0) / log(sd1/sd0)`.

- Legacy `viewExtentProgression` input is converted to `veScaleRamp` at
  load time using a canonical 1113 CSS px height. This value matches the
  historical tuning baseline (maximized browser window on the development
  machine), giving a 1:1 behavioural match for existing styles.

- `VerticalExaggerationSpecification` in `style.ts` is a strict
  discriminated union: new format (`elevationRamp`/`scaleRamp`) or legacy
  format (`heightRamp`/`viewExtentProgression`), never mixed.

- `rendererCssDpi` (default 96) is a new renderer config param for
  deployments where CSS DPI differs from the standard 96.

### Non-obvious finding: hitmap framebuffer and `curSize`

During label hierarchy computation, the engine periodically switches to
a fixed-size offscreen framebuffer (hitmap). This temporarily sets
`curSize = [hitmapSize, hitmapSize]`. Any code reading `this.css()[1]`
during this window gets the framebuffer height instead of the viewport
height.

**Fix:** `mainViewportCssH` — a dedicated field updated only in
`applySizes` (called on real viewport resize). `currentScaleDenominator`
uses this field instead of `this.css()[1] * this.visibleScale_[1]`.

### Renames

| Old name | New name |
|---|---|
| `getSeProgressionFactor` | `getVeScaleFactor` |
| `setSuperElevationProgression` | `setVeScaleRampFromProgression` (deprecated) |
| `seProgression` / `SeProgression` | `veScaleRamp` / `VeScaleRamp` |
